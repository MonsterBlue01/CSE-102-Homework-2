Lab1: Intro to Logic Simulation

-----------

DESCRIPTION

In this lab,the user needs to connect the digital circuit in Part A. At the same, the user needs to make the lights in Part B
light up according to the method in the truth table as required. Moreover, users need to replace the XOR gates with other logic
gates in the first part of Part C. In the second part, only NAND gates are allowed to be used. Finally, in the third part, only
NOR is allowed to be used.
